abstract = {[Abridged]. We present SEDs for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) covering the optical range at resolution 2.3A (FWHM). These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with MILES empirical stellar library, which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of MILES allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old age regimes, and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H]=-2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or line-strengths. For the latter we propose a new Line Index System (LIS) to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as function of wavelength the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analyzed at three different resolutions: 5A, 8.4A and 14A (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system are provided. A web-page with a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra is available at http://miles.iac.es.},

abstract = {We study the stellar populations of 1923 elliptical galaxies at z < 0.05 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, and environment. Our sample constitutes among the largest high-fidelity samples of elliptical galaxies with uniform imaging and optical spectroscopy assembled to date. Confirming previous studies, we find that elliptical galaxies dominate at high luminosities (gsimL*), and that the highest-$\sigma$ ellipticals favor high-density environments. We construct average, high signal-to-noise spectra in bins of $\sigma$ and environment and find the following: (1) lower-$\sigma$ galaxies have a bluer optical continuum and stronger (but still weak) emission lines; (2) at fixed $\sigma$, field ellipticals have a slightly bluer stellar continuum, especially at wavelengths lsim4000 \AA, and have stronger (but still weak) emission lines compared with their group counterparts, although this environmental dependence is strongest for low-$\sigma$ ellipticals and the highest-$\sigma$ ellipticals are much less affected. Based on Lick indices measured from both the individual and average spectra, we find that (1) at a given $\sigma$, elliptical galaxies in groups have systematically weaker Balmer absorption than their field counterparts, although this environmental dependence is most pronounced at low $\sigma$ (2) there is no clear environmental dependence of langFerang, while the $\alpha$-element absorption indices such as Mg b are only slightly stronger in galaxies belonging to rich groups. An analysis based on simple stellar populations (SSPs) reveals that more massive elliptical galaxies are older, more metal-rich, and more strongly $\alpha$-enhanced. We also find that (1) the SSP-equivalent ages of galaxies in rich groups are, on average, \~{}1 Gyr older than in the field, although once again this effect is strongest at low $\sigma$ (2) galaxies in rich groups have slightly lower [Fe/H] and are marginally more strongly $\alpha$-enhanced and (3) there is no significant environmental dependence of total metallicity, [Z/H]. Our results are generally consistent with stronger low-level recent star formation in field ellipticals at low $\sigma$, similar to recent results based on ultraviolet and infrared observations. We conclude with a brief discussion of our results in the context of recent theoretical models of elliptical galaxy formation.},

@article{Mancone2012,
abstract = {We present EzGal, a flexible python program designed to easily generate observable parameters (magnitudes, colors, mass-to-light ratios) for any stellar population synthesis (SPS) model. As has been demonstrated by various authors, the choice of input SPS models can be a significant source of systematic uncertainty. A key strength of EzGal is that it enables simple, direct comparison of different models sets. EzGal is also capable of generating composite stellar population models (CSPs) and can interpolate between metallicities for a given model set. We have created a web interface to run EzGal and generate observables for a variety of star formation histories and model sets. We make many commonly used SPS models available from this interface; the BC03 models, an updated version of these models, the Maraston models, the BaSTI models, and finally the FSPS models. We use EzGal to compare magnitude predictions for the model sets as a function of wavelength, age, metallicity, and star formation history. We recover the well-known result that the models agree best in the optical for old, solar metallicity models, with differences at the \~{}0.1 magnitude level. The most problematic regime for SPS modeling is for young ages (<2 Gyrs) and long wavelengths (lambda >7500 Angstroms) where scatter between models can vary from 0.3 mags (Sloan i) to 0.7 mags (Ks). We find that these differences are best understood as general uncertainties in SPS modeling. Finally we explore a more physically motivated example by generating CSPs with a star formation history matching the global star formation history of the universe. We demonstrate that the wavelength and age dependence of SPS model uncertainty translates into a redshift dependent model uncertainty, highlighting the importance of a quantitative understanding of model differences when comparing observations to models as a function of redshift.},

abstract = {We applied the VESPA algorithm to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey final data release of the Main Galaxies and Luminous Red Galaxies samples. The result is a catalog of stellar masses, detailed star formation and metallicity histories and dust content of nearly 800,000 galaxies. We make the catalog public via a T-SQL database, which is described in detail in this paper. We present the results using a range of stellar population and dust models, and will continue to update the catalog as new and improved models are made public. We also present a brief exploration of the catalog, and show that the quantities derived are robust: luminous red galaxies can be described by one to three populations, whereas a main galaxy sample galaxy needs on average two to five; red galaxies are older and less dusty; the dust values we recover are well correlated with measured Balmer decrements and star formation rates are also in agreement with previous measurements. We find that whereas some derived quantities are robust to the choice of modelling, many are still not.  .},

@article{Tojeiro2010,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the evolution of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in the latest and final spectroscopic data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We test the scenario of passive evolution of LRGs in 0.15<z<0.5, by looking at the evolution of the number and luminosity density of LRGs, as well as of their clustering. A new weighting scheme is introduced that allows us to keep a large number of galaxies in our sample and put stringent constraints on the growth and merging allowed by the data as a function of galaxy luminosity. Introducing additional luminosity-dependent weighting for our clustering analysis allows us to additionally constrain the nature of the mergers. We find that, in the redshift range probed, the population of LRGs grows in luminosity by 1.5-6 \% Gyr\^{}-1 depending on their luminosity. This growth is predominantly happening in objects that reside in the lowest-mass haloes probed by this study, and cannot be explained by satellite accretion into massive LRGs, nor by LRG-LRG merging. We find that the evolution of the brightest objects (with a K+e-corrected M\_r,0.1 < -22.8) is consistent with that expected from passive evolution.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel technique for empirically understanding galaxy evolution. We use empirically determined stellar evolution models to predict the past evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample without any a-priori assumption about galaxy evolution. By carefully contrasting the evolution of the predicted and observed number and luminosity densities we test the passive evolution scenario for galaxies of different luminosity, and determine minimum merger rates. We find that the LRG population is not purely coeval, with some of galaxies targeted at z<0.23 and at z>0.34 showing different dynamical growth than galaxies targeted throughout the sample. Our results show that the LRG population is dynamically growing, and that this growth must be dominated by the faint end. For the most luminous galaxies, we find lower minimum merger rates than required by previous studies that assume passive stellar evolution, suggesting that some of the dynamical evolution measured previously was actually due to galaxies with non-passive stellar evolution being incorrectly modelled. Our methodology can be used to identify and match coeval populations of galaxies across cosmic times, over one or more surveys.},
